# Java-Capstone-Project

My goal for this project is to allow the user to keep track of the properties that they own as well as the buildings and units that that are associated with each property.

## Main Features
* Users can get a list of their properties, buildings and units.
* Users can add to the list of their their properties buildings and units.
* Users can update individual properties, buildings and units.
* Users can delete properties that will also delete the buildings and units associated with it.
* Users can delete builidngs that will also delete the associated units.
* User can delete individual units.

## MakeUp
This project uses Java, Spring, Hibernate, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and PostgreSQL. Entity, DTO, Repository, Controller and Services classes were created for Landlords, Properties, Buildings and Units in order to complete the back end. While HTML, CSS and JavaScript files for Register, Login, Property, Building and Units were created for the front end.
